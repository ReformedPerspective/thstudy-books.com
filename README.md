# The Study <thestudy-books.com>[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5d3d197e-9266-46bb-836b-21364dc27a59/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/thestudybooks/deploys)

This is the website for **The Study**, a not-for-profit organization operated by members of the Canadian Reformed Churches.

## Hugo

This site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) open source static site generator. The [Hargo theme](https://gethugothemes.com/products/hargo/) was used as a starting point, but has been highly modified to the point where it isn't recognizable anymore ;-)

## Netlify

Netlify is used to deploy *thestudy-books.com* on GItHub commits to the **master** branch.

## Netlify CMS

Netlify CMS has been custom-made to support the creation and editing of books and content in a nicely laid-out user interface. Headless CMS rocks!
