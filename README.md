# How the Site is Built

## Hugo - Site Generator

This site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) open source static site generator. The [Hargo theme](https://gethugothemes.com/products/hargo/) was used as a starting point, but has been highly modified to the point where it isn't recognizable anymore ;-)

## GitHub - Version Control and Collaboration

The site is stored on GitHub under the Reformed Perspective 'Organization'.

## Netlify - Automatic Deployment

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is used to deploy *thestudy-books.com* on GItHub commits to the **master** branch.

## Netlify CMS - Headless Front-end

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) has been custom-made to support the creation and editing of books and content in a nicely laid-out user interface. Headless CMS rocks!

# Development Setup

In order to get things set up to work on thestudy-books.com you'll need Hugo, Git and some kind of text editor or IDE, likely one with Git integration, although that's not necessary.

## Install Hugo

The first thing you'll need is Hugo. Follow the [directions on the Hugo website]([Install Hugo | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)) to get it installed on your machine. Hugo is cross-platform and can easily be installed on [Linux](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#linux), [MacOS](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#macos) and [Windows](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing#windows).

## Clone the Site with Git

If you're on Windows install Git from the [official website](https://gitforwindows.org) or through Chocolatey. You'll have to get access to the Reformed Perspective GitHub organization. Contact tech@reformedperspective.ca if you haven't already.
