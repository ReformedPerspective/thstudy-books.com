The Study (formerly known as Inter-League Publication Board, or ILPB) is a non-profit organization operated by members of the Canadian Reformed Churches who commission and publish Reformed books to enrich and promote the study of Scripture.

All literature recommended and published by The Study must be faithful to God’s infallible Word and also in accordance with the Three Forms of Unity held by the American and Canadian Reformed Churches: the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the Canons of Dordt.​
