subtitle: Christ's Final Words from the Cross
description: The “Seven Wondrous Words” of Christ on the cross are truly
  “wondrous” - they reflect the wonder of who our Saviour is and what he has
  accomplished for us in his crucifixion. When we contemplate these sayings, we
  cannot help but be in awe of what God has done for our rescue. In this book,
  Rev. Bredenhof focuses on one Word at a time, and highlights the wonder of the
  gospel, and our salvation. (Seven outlines, each with questions)
