title: The View From Above
subtitle: An Exposition of God's Revelation to John
description: In *The View from Above*, Jan DeGelder ably unfolds the meaning of
  Revelation's cosmic drama. Like the book of Revelation itself, this volume
  inspires hope and confidence. DeGelder is refreshingly honest about not having
  all the answers to this fascinating, 'noisy' book (as he likes to call it),
  and yet he demonstrates throughout just how clearly and directly Revelation
  speaks to the church of Christ today. In our post-Christian and secularized
  world, DeGelder's persistent focus on the reality that Christ has conquered,
  reigns on high, and is coming in victory provides deep comfort and hope.
