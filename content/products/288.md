description: After a brief introduction, this workbook takes the Bible student
  on an in-depth exploration of the riches to be found in Paul's Letter to the
  Romans. Questions drive you to explore points of doctrine (with frequent
  references to the Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort, and Belgic
  Confession), and then to reflect on how these apply to your personal and
  church life. 21 Outlines with questions.
