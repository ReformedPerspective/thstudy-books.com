title: Haggai, Prophet for Godâ€™s House
subtitle: null
description: This book provides a basic explanation of Haggai's prophecy, and
  shows it speaks to us of Christ and the gospel. He speaks of a believer's
  priorities to a time in which priorities are often badly askew. He speaks of
  the covenant to a time in which the biblical reality of God's covenant is
  often neglected. He speaks of God's house to an age in which many Christians
  have only a limited understanding of what God's house is and its significance.
  We need Haggai and his message for today. 5 Outlines with questions.
