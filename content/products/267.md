title: "Joshua: God's Covenant Promises"
description: This book deals with the fulfillment of God’s covenant promises to
  Abraham. We see that Israel’s possession of Canaan was not an end in itself,
  but a guarantee of the eternal homeland. That is what still lies ahead for us.
  For that reason it is very fruitful to read and discuss the book of Joshua.
  The events in Joshua form a shadow of what is still to come. 15 outlines, each
  with discussion questions.
