title: Solus Christus - ePub
description: "*Solus Christus*-*Christ Alone* - is one of the five pillars of
  the Reformation. We would expect it to be universally accepted. Though many
  affirm Christ as Saviour, Christ as the *only* Redeemer is harder to accept.
  This *Christless Christianity* can easily creep into Reformed circles as well.
  In this book Rev. Bredenhof deftly helps the reader understand what *Solus
  Christus* means, why it is important, and how to respond to those who deny it
  or undermine it. This book has three chapters with discussion questions and
  includes two related sermons."
