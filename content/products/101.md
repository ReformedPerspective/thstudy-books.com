subtitle: An Exposition of God's Revelation to John
description: "In *The View from Above*, Jan DeGelder ably unfolds the meaning of Revelation's cosmic drama. Like the book of Revelation itself, this volume inspires hope and confidence. DeGelder is refreshingly honest about not having all the answers to this fascinating, 'noisy' book (as he likes to call it), and yet he demonstrates throughout just how clearly and directly Revelation speaks to the church of Christ today. In our post-Christian and secularized world, DeGelder's persistent focus on the reality that Christ has conquered, reigns on high, and is coming in victory provides deep comfort and hope."
