title: "Philippians: Joy in Knowing Christ"
description: In order to explore the riches of this letter, this study guide
  contains more questions than explanations. This causes the reader to determine
  what the text says, what the passage means, and how the section applies to our
  lives. Throughout the book the central theme of <strong>joy<strong> is made
  clear; joy in Christ, because of Christ, and with Christ. The end conclusion
  will be that knowing Christ, belonging to him, is worth more than anything
  else.
