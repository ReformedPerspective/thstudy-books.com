title: Outlines on Esther - ePub
subtitle: God Rules Over All
description: These outlines clearly portray God’s active role in redemptive
  history, even in a Bible book in which his Name is never mentioned. The
  reader’s attention is also drawn, time and again, to the place God’s
  providence plays in the lives of his children. Rich in detail, this book is
  easy reading, and suitable for both personal and group Bible study. 8
  outlines, each with questions.
