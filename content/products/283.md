Raymond J. Sikkema (1935) emigrated as a young boy from The Netherlands to the USA. While serving in the US Army in Anchorage, Alaska, he became aware of the Lord's call to prepare himself for the Gospel ministry. In 1963 he graduated from Calvin Theological Seminary. He served as pastor for four congregations in the CRC, until in 1992 the church he was serving left the CRC to join what eventually became the URCNA. Rev. Sikkema retired in 2000, but continues to preach and teach catechism in URC and CanRC congregations. Rev. Sikkema and his wife Chris have been blessed with 7 children, 37 grandchildren and an ever-growing number (70+) of great-grandchildren.
