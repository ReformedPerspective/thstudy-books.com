subtitle: A Study of The Beatitudes
description: In these outlines Rev. Sikkema examines each of the beatitudes of
  Matthew 5 in turn. In a conversational tone, and using practical examples, he
  explains who is being blessed, and what Jesus really means with each blessing.
  That we are covenant children of the Great King plays a key role in these
  explanations. Additional reading, suggested songs, and questions are also
  included with each of the 9 outlines.
