description: "*Solus Christus*-*Christ Alone* - is one of the five pillars of the Reformation. We would expect it to be universally accepted. Though many affirm Christ as Saviour, Christ as the *only* Redeemer is harder to accept. This *Christless Christianity* can easily creep into Reformed circles as well. In this book Rev. Bredenhof deftly helps the reader understand what *Solus Christus* means, why it is important, and how to respond to those who deny it or undermine it. This book has three chapters with discussion questions and includes two related sermons."
