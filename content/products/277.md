description: At the court of the Babylonian king, there is a battle going on
  between the kingdom of Satan and the kingdom of God. What happened at the
  court of Babylon is part of the history of salvation. This book opens the eyes
  of the reader to see how that ancient history is the history of salvation, and
  so also our history. Another major theme in these outlines is that God is
  trustworthy, and provides for those who trust in him. This book contains *12
  outlines*, each with questions that direct deeper thought on these themes.
