description: This book makes it possible to comfortably dig deep into this
  portion of scripture. The outlines help focus the discussion on how we, as
  heirs of the grace of life, experience this grace as we struggle with love –
  its growth, challenges and triumphs. Although we are sinners and live in a
  broken world, by God’s grace it is possible for a man and a woman to love each
  other and have a wonderful God-pleasing relationship. 6 Outlines with
  questions.

Agema has a keen interest in missions, and initially planned to go to Brazil as a missionary, but in the end he was not able to start his work there.
