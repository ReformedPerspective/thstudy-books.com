Jan Smelik (1899-1960) was a graduate of the seminary of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in Kampen. He served as a minister within the federation of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and ministered to four congregations. He had a love for teaching adolescents and it was always his goal to convey in a clear manner the depth and riches of the Gospel to his audience. He contributed to a series of books paraphrasing the Bible and numerous of his sermons were published during his lifetime. Smelik also published several study guides and outlines, most notably on Ephesians and Peter.
