description: In this book we see that life in the covenant with the LORD is not
  empty or in vain. It has a future. When The Teacher wrote, that future was the
  coming of the Messiah; today it is our Saviour's return. And because life in
  the covenant has a future, it also has a present. The LORD requires of us that
  we work in his kingdom; that we do whatever our hands find to do; that we
  fulfill our cultural mandate. 15 outlines with discussion questions.
