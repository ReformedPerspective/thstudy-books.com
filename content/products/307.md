description: "Encouraging others isn't always easy to do, but it is required by

  that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness' Hebrews 3:13. This
  study guide has fifteen short lessons covering our relationships, in the home,
  at work and within the church community. To help the reader engage in
  meaningful reflection and application, the study guide also includes
  stimulating questions - with ample space for the reader to record their
  responses."
