title: Walking and Talking with God
description: Four Lectures on the Old Testament. What can the Old Testament
  teach us about our relationship with God? Dr. John Smith gave four lectures
  for the Free Reformed Churches of Australia. Though the topics are quite
  varied (Exodus, Psalms, Friendship, and Vows), there is a common thread that
  runs through all four, that of walking and talking with God. Each lecture
  includes a discussion guide, making this an ideal resource for Bible study
  groups. How does archaeology help us to dig into Exodus? What's the best way
  to study the book of Psalms? Are we allowed to call God our friend? Should
  Christians make vows to God? Find out what the Old Testament tells us about
  walking and talking with God. 4 lectures, each with study questions *This is a
  Pro Ecclesia publication.*
