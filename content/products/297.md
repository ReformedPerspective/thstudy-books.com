description: "The church at Colossae was suffering from false teachings. The Holy Spirit, through Paul, refutes these heresies, and sets forth the majesty and glory of the Lord. The deceptive emptiness of human philosophy is contrasted with the fullness and sufficiency of Christ. Finally, Paul cites the faith and experiences of his readers and encourages them to live as members of Christ. 10 Outlines; no questions included."
