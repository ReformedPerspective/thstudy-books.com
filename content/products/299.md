Rev. Agema was born in the Netherlands in 1957 and began his studies for the ministry at the theological seminary of Reformed churches in Kampen. He completed his studies at the Theological College of the Canadian Reformed Churches in Hamilton, Ontario in 1984. Rev. Agema has a keen interest in missions, and initially planned to go to Brazil as a missionary, but in the end he was not able to start his work there. He has served as minister in several congregations in Canada and is also a part-time faculty member at Covenant Canadian Reformed Teacherâ€™s College, where he teaches several courses related to Bible curriculum.
