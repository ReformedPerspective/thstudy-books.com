title: Aiming To Please
subtitle: A Guide to Reformed Worship
description: In 19 chapters, Wes Bredenhof explains in his unique, readable
  style, how Reformed worship aims to help us please God more and more.  All
  aspects of the service come under scrutiny:  Is singing hymns biblical? 
  Should the congregation say the votum?  Why collection bags?  Lord's Supper in
  the pews?  And what about the role of organists, drums, the celebration of
  Christmas, and the use of projectors?  Does covenant theology make a
  difference to how we worship?  These topics and many more are addressed from
  the stance that we are not to worship God in any other manner than He has
  commanded in His Word.
