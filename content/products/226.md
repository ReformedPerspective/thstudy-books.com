Rev. de Wolff (1901 â€“ 1976) completed his studies at the seminary in Kampen and was ordained as minister of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1930. He actively served two congregations in the Netherlands during his thirty-five year ministry. Rev. de Wolff was known for his love of the Scriptures and he tirelessly studied the Bible. He was an able exegete, never satisfied to rely on what others had written, but always returning to the original language texts to grasp the true meaning of any passage. Rev. de Wolff once told a colleague that every text of the Bible was a window to the whole of Scripture. He wrote several longer studies as well as numerous articles for various church magazines.
