Dr. Rolf Hendrik Bremmer (1917-1995) was born in the Netherlands and was a graduate of the seminary of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. He obtained his doctorate from the Free University of Amsterdam and in 1982 he was awarded the Order of Orange-Nassau as an officer, for his contributions to church and society. He served three congregations in the Netherlands over a period of 47 years. During his active ministry, Dr. Bremmer still found the time to write prolifically in the areas of theology, and church history. He also lectured in Bible instruction and Bible storytelling at an educational institution which trained kindergarten instructors. His strength was in making his writing and preaching understandable and applicable to everyday life.
