subtitle: Song of Songs of Solomon
description: This book makes it possible to comfortably dig deep into this
  portion of scripture. The outlines help focus the discussion on how we, as
  heirs of the grace of life, experience this grace as we struggle with love –
  its growth, challenges and triumphs. Although we are sinners and live in a
  broken world, by God’s grace it is possible for a man and a woman to love each
  other and have a wonderful God-pleasing relationship. 6 Outlines with
  questions.
